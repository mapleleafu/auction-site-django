# eBay-like E-Commerce Auction Site

An eBay-inspired e-commerce auction site was developed to enhance my skills in web development. Dive in to see how users can engage in auctions, add their favorite items to a watchlist, comment, and more! This project was built as Project 2 for HarvardX's 'CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript' course.
